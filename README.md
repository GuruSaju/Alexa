## If you don’t own a echo device

If you have an android phone you are one of the lucky ones.

Amazon has not yet rolled this feature up for IOS but it is on the way. Meanwhile here is the workaround. 

Once you have enabled the skill on your app in ios. Download the amazon app with below logo.

Open the amazon app not the amazon alexa app. Login with same credentials that you used for amazon alexa app. 
Now tap on the alexa icon. just below the shopping cart in the upper right corner.

## What to ask Alexa:

### Description:
Everything should be in the description of the app. But let me repeat it here.
This skill allows you to ask Guru questions on his likes, job, education, work experience, his technical skills, projects, publications, certifications, interests or you could ask to contact him and get his email address. 
If you think you know him well enough then take the quiz, How well do you know guru! a simple game of quiz about guru and see how well you score.

### Phrases:
A little background - once you enable a skill there will be an invocation name for that skill (guru’s diary) for my skill. So you have to use the invocation name to use my skill as described below. If the session is open (the blue ring on echo devices and blue line in your app glows) you can just ask alexa about me without the invocation name.
Eg: what is his favorite movie? 
But if the session ends then you should use the invocation name (guru’s diary) to ask about me 
Eg: ask guru’s diary, what is his favorite color ?

### Using the skill with phrases:

say "open guru's diary" then you can ask things like "technical skills", "favorite color" etc. (until session is open meaning the blue ring on echo devices and blue line in your app glows) 

Or use phrases like
"ask guru's diary about his technical skills"
"ask guru's diary for his contact"
"ask guru's diary about his publications"
"ask guru's diary what is his favorite song"
